## 📌 Key Insights

1. **Sales Type vs Sales Cost**
   - Horizontal bar charts show cost variations by type.
   - Channel type adds color to distinguish distribution.

2. **Channel Type Insights**
   - Stacked bar plots compare channel type and sales cost.
   - Color-coded by sales type or pay type (e.g., cash, cheque, FedEx, DHL).

3. **Sales Composition**
   - Side-by-side circle plots for multi-dimensional analysis of sales type, channel, and cost.

4. **Item Category Performance**
   - Bar and pie charts comparing item categories by department and sales metrics.
   - Colored by relevant dimensions for deeper insight.

5. **Payment Method Analysis**
   - Box-and-whisker plots and stacked bars reveal the spread and trends across different payment types.
